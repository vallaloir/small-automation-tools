# Scripts

Set of scripts needed for tools that cannot be run with Marimo or as a static page in GitHub Pages. Instead, Marimo contains a download button to download the batch file, which downloads uv and runs the script. The batch file can be run by double clicking it or dragging and dropping the relevant file to it.
