# Scripts

Set of scripts needed for tools that cannot be run with Marimo or as a static page in GitHub Pages. Instead, Marimo contains two download buttons: one to download the necessary script and another to download a batch file to be able to run it by double clicking it or dragging and dropping the relevant file to it.
